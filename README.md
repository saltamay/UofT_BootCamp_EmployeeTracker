## About

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. This Node.js CLI application is developed to be a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Business Context

Following the common templates for user stories, this challenge can be framed as follows for various stakeholders:

As a Business Owner, Manager and/or HR Personnel:

```
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company

So that I can organize and plan my business.
```

```
I want to tbe able to:

  Add departments, roles, employees

  View departments, roles, employees

  Update employee roles

and also:

  Update employee managers

  View employees by manager

  Delete departments, roles, and employees

  View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
```

## Minimum Requirements

- Functional application.

- GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.

  - Add departments, roles, employees

  - View departments, roles, employees

  - Update employee roles

## Bonus

- The command-line application should allow users to:

  - Update employee managers

  - View employees by manager

  - Delete departments, roles, and employees

## Development Strategy

1. Design the following database schema containing three tables:

- **department**:

  - **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  - **name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

- **role**:

  - **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  - **title** - VARCHAR(30) to hold role title
  - **salary** - DECIMAL to hold role salary
  - **department_id** - INT to hold reference to department role belongs to

- **employee**:

  - **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  - **first_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
  - **last_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
  - **role_id** - INT to hold reference to role employee has
  - **manager_id** - INT to hold reference to another employee that manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager

2. Include a `seed.js` file to pre-populate database.

3. Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

4. Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

5. Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better.

6. Final application should look like the example below:
